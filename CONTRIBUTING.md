# Contributing to Ionic Native

Have a plugin you'd like to see supported? Because Ionic Native is a thin wrapper around existing Cordova plugins, adding support for new plugins is as easy as creating a new wrapper for whichever plugin you'd like to add.

Take a look at our [Developer Guide](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/blob/master/DEVELOPER.md) for more info on adding new plugins.
